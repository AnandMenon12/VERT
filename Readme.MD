# ðŸŒŸ VERT: A SystemVerilog Assertion Dataset to Improve Hardware Verification with LLMs

Hardware verification is a critical aspect of System-on-Chip (SoC) design, accounting for up to **70% of development time**. In this context, **SystemVerilog assertions** play a pivotal role in ensuring design functionality. However, as systems grow more complex, manual assertion generation becomes increasingly challenging. 

To address these challenges, we present **VERT** â€” a dataset designed to enhance the capabilities of **open-source LLMs** for automated assertion generation. Fine-tuned models, such as **Deepseek Coder 6.7B** and **Llama 3.1 8B**, achieve up to **96.88% correctness** on platforms like **OpenTitan** and **CVA6** compared to base models. VERT minimizes the dependency on costly proprietary models like GPT-4o, offering a scalable and efficient solution for hardware verification.

## âœ¨ Key Features

### 1. **Comprehensive Assertion Generation**
   VERT includes a broad collection of **SystemVerilog assertions** covering a range of conditional structures, enabling LLMs to learn and generate assertions for diverse logical flows within hardware designs.

### 2. **Synchronous and Asynchronous Variants**
   The dataset is supplemented with **synchronous** (`synch`) and **asynchronous** code snippets, aiding LLMs in distinguishing and accurately handling time-sensitive, clock-driven, combinational, and sequential logic.

### 3. **Fine-Tuning Capability**
   VERT is designed to fine-tune smaller, **open-source LLMs** like **Deepseek Coder 6.7B** and **Llama 3.1 8B**, empowering them to outperform proprietary models in both **functional** and **syntactical correctness**. Fine-tuning with VERT yields over a **20% improvement** in certain cases compared to GPT-4o.
   - Enables **local fine-tuning**, reducing reliance on costly proprietary solutions and ensuring **data privacy** for hardware companies.

### 4. **Tested for Industry-Standard Platforms**
   Assertions generated using VERT have been validated on **industry-standard platforms** like **OpenTitan**, **CVA6**, and **Pulpissimo SoCs**, making it highly relevant for real-world hardware verification scenarios.

### 5. **Scalability and Cost-Effectiveness**
   Utilizing smaller open-source models fine-tuned with VERT significantly reduces computational and financial overhead, providing a **scalable, efficient solution** for assertion generation without sacrificing performance.

These features make **VERT** a comprehensive and powerful dataset for automating hardware verification, reducing manual effort, and streamlining the verification process using advanced LLMs.
